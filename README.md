# Active_losses_Swissgrid

## Overview
This repository corresponds to a proposal of solution for the ML Engineer Challenge that can be found [here](https://github.com/Swissgrid-AG-External/coding_challenges/blob/main/ml_engineer/intern/README.md). The 3 main goals of this challenge are the followings:
1. write a markdown file (Approach.md) to describe the approach taken
2. Refactor the notebooks into clean, well-organized pyhton file while preserving existing functionalities. The primary goal was to enhance code structure, readability, and maintainability.
3. Change or add 1 or 2 functions to the script

The proposed solution offers a more understandable and easy-to-use code that achieves the following:
- loading the data 
- preprocessing the data and addition of useful features (time, date, holidays, cyclical_features, lag features)
- finetuning ElasticNet model 
- training the model and visualization of predictions over test data 
- training model on entire dataset with best hyperparameters and saving it for later use

## Installation
Python 3.11.5 was used for this project
- conda env create -f environment.yaml
- conda activate active_loss

## Stucture of the data folder
For more details on the raw data refer to [data_explanation.md](https://github.com/yanis-trn/Active_losses_Swissgrid/blob/main/data/raw/data_explanation.md). For more details on how the preprocessed data is obtained refer to the preprocessing.py file.
```
├── data
│   ├── processed
│   │   └── df_preprocessed.csv     <- generated by the code after preprocessing and feature engineering 
│   └── raw
│       ├── data_explanation.md     
│       ├── Active-Losses.csv       <- historical active losses data, unit: kWh per 15 minutes
│       ├── NTC.csv                 <- net transfer capacity between two areas
│       ├── eq_renewables.csv       <- forecast-renewable-generation (unit: MW)
│       └── eq_temp.csv             <- forecast temperature (unit: °C)
```

## Additionnal visualization of the forecasting quality
In order for different stakeholders to realize and assess the quality of the forecasting an additionnal function (train_and_visualize_model_predictions) was added. It allows to easily save plots of the predictions from the ElasticNet model with the best hyperparameters. Such a plot is represented below:
